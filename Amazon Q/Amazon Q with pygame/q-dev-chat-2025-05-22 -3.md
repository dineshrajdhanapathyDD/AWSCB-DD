Write a short and high-quality python script for the following task, something a very skilled python expert would write. You are writing code for an experienced developer so only add comments for things that are non-obvious. Make sure to include any imports required. 
NEVER write anything before the ```python``` block. After you are done generating the code and after the ```python``` block, check your work carefully to make sure there are no mistakes, errors, or inconsistencies. 
If there are errors, list those errors in tags, then generate a new version with those errors Ô¨Åxed. If there are no errors, write &quot;CHECKED: NO ERRORS&quot; in tags. 

Here is the task: write a greedy snake game.
Double check your work to ensure no errors or inconsistencies.

I'll share updates here as I work on this.

**Summary of changes**
1. First, I'll explore the repository to locate where the snake's speed is controlled. I'll start by examining snake_game.py since it's likely the main game file.
2. I found that the game speed is controlled by the clock.tick(10) call on line 100. The value 10 represents the frames per second (FPS) - lowering this number will make the game slower and easier for beginners.
3. The test file doesn't contain any tests related to game speed, so we won't need to update it. I'll now modify the snake_game.py file to reduce the speed by lowering the FPS from 10 to 5 for a more beginner-friendly experience.
4. I've successfully modified the game speed by reducing the FPS from 10 to 5, which will make the snake move at half the original speed, making it much more manageable for beginners. No test updates were needed since the game speed wasn't part of the test suite.

The code works, but the speed of the snake is too fast. I&#39;m just a beginner at the game, could you adjust the game&#39;s speed for me?

Okay, I updated your code files. Would you like to work on another task?
